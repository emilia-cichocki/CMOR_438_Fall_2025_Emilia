# Unsupervised Learning Package

This package contains various unsupervised learning algorithms. It includes modules for **... (this will be updated in a future iteration)**

### Modules
- PCA

- Clustering

- DBSCAN

***readmes shoud have appropriate title relative to name of directory, description, algorithm empty subsection, data empty subsection (to be filled in)***

decision trees ensemble methods knn linear logistic multilayer + regular perceptron regression trees -> supervised learning

fit, predict, gini or entropy from classification -> dimensionality reduction combined w/ decision trees
decision trees = notorious for overfitting -> need to specify depth 
- want random shuffling on axes

regression trees -> still divides feature space into several regions (different from other regression techniques)
