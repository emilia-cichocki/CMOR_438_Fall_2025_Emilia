# Examples for Machine Learning Algorithms

This folder contains the examples for supervised and unsupervised learning, which are further divided based on algorithm.

### Contents
For further description, see the READMEs in the following folders:
- [`supervised_learning_examples`](supervised_learning_examples/README.md): examples for supervised learning algorithms
- [`unsupervised_learning_examples`](unsupervised_learning_examples/README.md): examples for unsupervised learning algorithms

### Data Used
All datasets used to evaluate the machine learning algorithms are available from publicly accessible databases, and most are able to be loaded directly from a package. Datasets were selected for their ability to display model performance and to facilitate comparison of results with other machine learning code. They include [Palmer Penguins](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data), [Breast Cancer Wisconsin](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data), [Wine](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine), and [Cora](https://graphsandnetworks.com/the-cora-dataset/); further description of the data particular to each algorithm can be found in the associated folder READMEs.
